"A Web GUI allowing building specialized AI tools (LLM, Computer vision, audio) with no code. GUI is based on nodes with user requirements as inputs and these requirements can be created either by human by generated by AI.
Minimum requirements:
user stories can be sent to the backend api multimodally: SMS, whatsapp, voice recorder
If no stories are presented they can be created by AI agents with or without human interference
The different models and FT options are represented as nodes in webui frontend. An AI agent can select or suggest a model
fine-tuning process also by nodes and either by AI agent or suggestions
Evaluation metrics and output visualizations in webui
AI agents analyze and create api for the product (produced AI agent) that can be incorporated to the user’s software. Agent will also inform, how the embedding to user’s system can be done.";The new way to incorporate AI to all existing business systems without the need for development team or process;['As a business executive, I want to build AI tools using a web GUI, in order to empower my organization with AI capabilities without needing a development team.', 'As a business analyst, I want to input user requirements via SMS, WhatsApp, or voice recorder, in order to create user stories for AI tool development.', 'As a user, I want AI agents to automatically generate user stories when none are provided, in order to streamline the AI tool creation process.', 'As a data scientist, I want to view and select from various AI models and fine-tuning options represented as nodes in the web UI, in order to tailor AI solutions to specific needs.', 'As a business user, I want to see evaluation metrics and output visualizations in the web UI, in order to assess the performance of the AI tools I create.', 'As a developer, I want AI agents to analyze the created AI tool and generate an API for integration, in order to easily embed the tool into existing business systems.', 'As a project manager, I want to receive notifications about the progress and suggestions provided by AI agents during the tool creation process, in order to stay informed and make timely decisions.', 'As a business user, I want to customize the parameters of the AI models in the web GUI, in order to better fit the specific needs of my organization.', 'As an executive, I want to have a dashboard overview of all AI tools created by my team, in order to monitor their performance and usage.', 'As a user, I want the AI agent to suggest best practices and tips for using the GUI effectively, in order to maximize my productivity.'];Make sure that the user stories actually make the business thrive better and the software development goals align with thi
